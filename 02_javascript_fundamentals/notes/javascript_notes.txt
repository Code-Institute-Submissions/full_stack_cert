# Fundamentals of Javascript


 INTRODUCTION
==============

How do we add Javascript to a webpage?
    * a browser also contains a Javascript interpreter
        - must specifically tell the browser when Javascript is included
            - use the <script> tag
    
Javascript allows us to directly interact with the Document Object Model (DOM)
    * HTML document is loaded into a web browser    
        - becomes a document object in Javascript
        - document object is the root node in the DOM

Javascript uses dot notation

Example:

document.write("<p>JS will interpret this</p>");
    * left of dot represents document
    * everything after the dot represents a function

Console: place where browswer outputs errors and information about page that is loading

Example:
 console.log("Hello, World!"); // Hello, World! prints inside the console

* use console.log() to debug and test code 


 VARIABLES
===========

variable is a way to reference something

Examples:
    var groceryList = ["milk", "bread", "cookies"];
    var pi = 3.1415926535;

Ways to declare a variable:
    * var
    * let
    * const

Expression => produces or results in some value
